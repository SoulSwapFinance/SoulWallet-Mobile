Mobile version run an [app runner](https://github.com/SoulSwapFinance/SoulWallet-Extension/tree/master/packages/web-runner) run in hidden webview and use message passing to interact with it.
There are 2 reasons why we do this:
- React native is not support WASM, we can't get full features of `@polkadot/packages` so we need to run most crypto features on webview.
- Using the same resources saves us not only development time, but also makes extension and mobile versioning more consistent
